### 3. Clone the Repository

###### To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let‚Äôs first open up a terminal window.

###### We‚Äôll use the `git clone`  command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.

### 4. Create a New Branch

###### To create your branch, from your terminal window, change your directory so that you are working in the directory of the repository.

#####    ` cd HacktoberFest2020-`


###### Now, we‚Äôll create our new branch with the git branch command. Make sure you name it descriptively so that others working on the project understand what you are working on.

##### `git branch new-branch`

###### Now that our new branch is created, we can switch to make sure that we are working on that branch by using the git checkout command:

##### ` git checkout new-branch `

##### ` git add -A ` or ` git add . `

##### ` git commit -m "Updated Readme.md" `



###### Then push to your local repository
##### ` git push origin new-branch `

### 5. Create Pull Request

###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.
